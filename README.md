A `R.E.P.O` mod for applying upgrades to all players.

## Another 'team upgrades' mod? Why?

The others don't work.

- [EvilCheetah's Team Upgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/EvilCheetah/TeamUpgrades/): Doesn't apply upgrades
  to players that 'late join' a save.
- [Traktool's Shared Upgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Traktool/SharedUpgrades/): Doesn't apply upgrades
  to players that 'late join' a save until a level is completed.
- [NastyPablo's LateJoinSharedUpgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/NastyPablo/LateJoinSharedUpgradesByNastyPablo/):
  Newly purchased upgrades are duplicated for 1 level, because player upgrade quantities are set to purchase quantities
  *before* upgrade items have been applied.
- All of the above: Health upgrades don't heal all players, only the player that applied the upgrade.

## How's it work?

This mod doesn't try to be host-only.
**All players must have the mod installed, or it won't work right.**
All players must also have the **same version** of the mod installed, or it probably won't work right.

This requirement may frustrate you, but it's not possible to ensure team upgrades work seamlessly otherwise.
If you really need a host-only mod, have a look at the mods linked above.
